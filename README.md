# Screenshot Extender
Screenshot Extender should become an Android application for enhancing screenshots.
I mainly need some bigger screenshots, also from parts of my screen that not visible at the moment.

Example Scenario:
I frequently search for traveling schedules and want to share it with friends. But not all my apps have the ability to share it, and often the schedule is bigger than one screenshot

##Ideas
- First of all a screenshot.
- While scrolling upwards the application should append the new pixel to the image.
  - possible loading of application content, could be a problem.
- Should work like a overlay for all installed applications.

##Security Issues
There are several issues according screenshots, thats the main reason why it should be open source and reviewed by many 

- possible to track keyboard input, therefore keyboard input should be excluded.
- don't make it available for direct Android intents.

##Things that are Important to me
- use as few Android permissions as possible.
